# Mosaic Life Creative - Landing Page Roadmap

## ✅ Completed

### Landing Page Foundation
- [x] Text sequence with four phases
- [x] Choice buttons (Like everyone else's / Like nothing else)
- [x] Hamburger nav with photo slideshow
- [x] Hunt modal with server-side validation
- [x] Countdown timer (3:16:23 PM, 42-second window)
- [x] Security: Server-side time validation (both sequence AND time window)
- [x] Obfuscated config (removed obvious hunt comments)

### Wheatley AI System (v1.4.2) - Feb 4, 2026
- [x] Anthropic API integration with Claude Haiku 4.5
- [x] Context-aware personality (visitor type, exact time, device, activity)
- [x] Time-based triggers (30s, 3m, 10m, 20m, 30m, +10m intervals)
- [x] 90-minute finale message with automatic shutoff
- [x] API failure fallback with self-aware error messaging
- [x] Clean UI: CTA text hidden when Wheatley appears, buttons remain
- [x] Cost control: ~$0.0015 per message, max 11 messages per visitor (~$0.015/engaged visitor)

### Design & Planning
- [x] Services page mockup/vision
- [x] Snake 451 game prototype (Fahrenheit 451 reference for hunt)
- [x] CSS v1.2.1, JS v1.4.2 deployed
